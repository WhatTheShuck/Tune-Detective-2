This project is the spiritual successor to Tune Detective 2, by n00tavailable. This was an app that used the Deezer API to fetch the latest releases from artists. I thought this was immensely useful, as I don't use Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, insert music streaming platform of choice here. Meaning that I don't often find out about new releases in a timely manner. Tune Detective filled that niche in my life, it was so perfect... But when the world needed him most, Github user N00tavailable vanished. A few months have passed and the Tune Detective app randomly stopped working. Two Weeks ago, my father and the men of my tribe... Alright cut the cringe avatar shit.

I decided to take on the task of recreating the app myself, this time as a Web App. It is a functional PWA and you should be able to install it on Android and iOS for a near native experience. The project is still under active development, apologies if it breaks ðŸ™ƒ

I intend to eventually make a native Android App, but that could be ages away...
